# Real-time-Multiplayer-Game-with-WebSockets
This project implements a real-time multiplayer game using WebSockets for smooth interaction between players. The game allows multiple players to connect, move within a shared space, and see updates in real time. The primary goal is to create a low-latency, interactive gaming experience using WebSockets for efficient bidirectional communication.

Key Components:

Node.js & Express: Backend server to handle player connections and serve the game.

WebSockets (ws library): Enables real-time communication between players.

Client-side Game Engine: Uses JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for rendering game elements.

Player State Management: Tracks player positions and updates them in real-time.

Broadcast System: Ensures all players receive updates when someone moves or disconnects.

Workflow:

Players connect to the WebSocket server and receive a unique player ID.

Each player's position is initialized and stored on the server.

When a player moves, their updated position is broadcast to all connected players.

Players can see others move in real-time through the game interface.

When a player disconnects, they are removed from the game, and others are notified.

Expected Outcomes:

A real-time multiplayer game with smooth player interactions.

Low-latency updates using WebSockets for efficient data transmission.

Scalable architecture that can support multiple concurrent players.

Potential for expanding into more complex multiplayer gaming mechanics.
